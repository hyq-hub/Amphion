# Debatts - Mandarin Debate TTS Model

## Introduction
Debatts is an advanced text-to-speech (TTS) model specifically designed for Mandarin debate contexts. This innovative model leverages short audio prompts to learn and replicate speaker characteristics while dynamically adjusting speaking style by analyzing the audio of debate opponents. This capability allows Debatts to integrate seamlessly into debate scenarios, offering not just speech synthesis but a responsive adaptation to the changing dynamics of debate interactions.

## Environment Setup
To set up the necessary environment to run Debatts, please use the provided `environment.yml` file. This file contains all the required dependencies and can be easily set up with the following Conda command:

```bash
